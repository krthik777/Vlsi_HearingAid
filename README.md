# Hearing Aid Noise Removal â€“ Verilog Simulation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **dual-stage noise removal system for hearing aids** in Verilog, based on the design from the paper *"Real-Time Noise Removal System for Hearing Aids: VLSI Implementation and Design Methodology"*.

The architecture consists of:  
1. **Spectral Subtraction Stage** â€“ Estimates background noise from initial samples and subtracts it from the incoming audio.  
2. **LMS Adaptive Filter Stage** â€“ Performs adaptive filtering to further suppress residual noise.  

A **Verilog testbench** simulates the system with input audio samples (from a file) and writes the processed output to another file.

## âš™ Requirements
- [Icarus Verilog](https://bleyer.org/icarus/) (for compiling & simulation)  
- [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) (optional, for waveform viewing if VCD dump is added)  
- A script/tool to convert `.wav` or `.mp3` audio into **16-bit signed integer PCM samples** for `input_samples.txt`.  

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hearing-aid-verilog.git
cd hearing-aid-verilog
```

### 2. Prepare input samples
Convert your `.wav` / `.mp3` file into 16-bit signed integers (e.g., using Python or MATLAB) and save them into:
```
input_samples.txt
```
Each line should contain one integer sample in the range `-32768` to `32767`.

### 3. Compile the project
```bash
iverilog -g2012 -o hearing_aid_sim hearing_aid_processor.v spectral_subtraction_stage.v lms_filter_stage.v hearing_aid_file_tb.v
```

### 4. Run the simulation
```bash
vvp hearing_aid_sim
```

This will read from `input_samples.txt` and generate `output_samples.txt`.

### 5. (Optional) View waveforms in GTKWave
If `$dumpfile`/`$dumpvars` are enabled in the testbench:
```bash
gtkwave hearing_aid.vcd
```

## ðŸ”§ Parameters You Can Tune
- `NOISE_LEN` in `spectral_subtraction_stage.v` â†’ Number of samples used for noise estimation  
- `FILTER_ORDER` in `lms_filter_stage.v` â†’ Number of FIR filter taps  
- `STEP_SIZE` in `lms_filter_stage.v` â†’ LMS adaptation step size  

---

## âš  Notes
- Make sure `input_samples.txt` contains **more samples than `NOISE_LEN`**, otherwise no output will be produced.  
- The output is written sample-by-sample into `output_samples.txt`.  
- Use external tools to convert `output_samples.txt` back into an audio file for listening tests.
